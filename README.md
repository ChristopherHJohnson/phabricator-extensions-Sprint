Sprints and burndowns in Phabricator

To install, [add this as a library](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/libraries/) to phabricator.

You can then create projects with a name that includes "Sprint" and edit it to add a start date and end date. Then add some tasks to that project, and edit them to set some story points. After that, go to the project and click "View burndown" in the actions. You can also view a list of projects with burndowns by going to the Burndown application.

Projects that have "Sprint" in their name have a "Sprint Start Date" and "Sprint End Date"

Tasks in Sprints have "Story Points"
